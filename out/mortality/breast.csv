"Data Source:"
"-U.S. Mortality Data (1969-2023), National Center for Health Statistics, CDC."
"Methodology:"
"-Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (20 age groups - Census P25-1130)."
"-The Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software [https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint], Version 5.4, April 2025, National Cancer Institute using the default settings."
"-The APC's/AAPC's direction is 'Rising' when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, 'Falling' when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered 'Not Significant'."
"Race/Ethnicity Coding:"
"-For more details on SEER race/ethnicity groupings, please see Race and Hispanic Ethnicity Changes [https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/race_ethnicity/]."
"-Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA). "
"Cancer Site Coding:"
"-Cancer site cause of death is defined using the SEER Cause of Death Recode 1969+ (03/01/2018) [https://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/1969_d03012018/index.html]."
