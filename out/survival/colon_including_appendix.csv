"Data Source:"
"-SEER Incidence Data, November 2024 Submission (1975-2022), SEER 21 registries [https://seer.cancer.gov/registries/terms.html] (excluding Illinois)."
"-Expected Survival Life Tables [https://seer.cancer.gov/expsurvival/] by Socio-Economic Standards."
"Methodology:"
"-The relative survival rates are calculated using annual intervals."
"-The trend's direction is 'Rising' when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, 'Falling' when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is labelled as 'Not Significant'."
"-The JPSurv (Joinpoint Survival Model) [https://analysistools.cancer.gov/jpsurv/] Software finds location and number of joinpoints (years of diagnosis at which survival trends have changed) that best fit the data. The estimates in this graph/table, use annual relative survival data with up to 10 years of follow-up for cancer patients diagnosed at each calendar year from 2000 through 2021. To summarize the trends in each segment between joinpoints, we use the average absolute change in survival (AAC_S). The AAC_S represents the average percentage points difference of cancer survival for people diagnosed in one calendar year compared to the prior year. For example, a 5-year survival increase from 50% to 60% for people diagnosed in 2000 versus 2010, represents a total increase of 10 percentage points in 10 years and an AAC_S of 1 percentage (survival) points for people diagnosed in a year compared to the previous during 2000 and 2010."

"Cancer Site Coding:"
"-See SEER*Explorer Cancer Site Definitions [https://seer.cancer.gov/statistics-network/explorer/cancer-sites.html] for details about the cancer site coding used for SEER Incidence data."
"-Stage at diagnosis is calculated using the Combined Summary Stage (2004+) recode, created from SEER Combined Summary Stage 2000 (2004-2017) & Derived Summary Stage 2018 (2018+). For more information, see the SEER documentation [https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/seer/lrd-stage]."
